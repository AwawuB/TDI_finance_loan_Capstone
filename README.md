# Finance Loan Project

### About the Project

#### Objective
To create an interactive Loan Data Analysis Dashboard using Excel that equips The Data Immersed (TDI) with insights into its loan portfolio, enabling management to make informed decisions on loan approvals, risk management, and customer satisfaction.


#### Scope
The project focuses on analyzing TDIâ€™s loan data, including customer demographics, loan performance metrics, and risk factors. It encompasses data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and the development of an interactive dashboard.


#### Problem Statement
TDI faces challenges such as high default rates, unclear borrower risk profiles, and inefficient interest rate assignments. A comprehensive dashboard is necessary to provide clarity on loan performance and borrower demographics.


#### Process:
- Data Cleaning and Transformation: Import and clean the dataset in Excel. 

- Data Analysis: Analyze key metrics using Excel formulas, pivot tables, and charts to understand default rates and the impact of interest rates.

- Dashboard Creation: Design an interactive dashboard with visual elements like charts and slicers for intuitive data exploration.
User Experience Optimization: Ensure the dashboard allows management to filter and drill down into data segments easily.


#### Insights:
The dashboard generate actionable insights, including:

- Analysis of loan default rates by customer demographics.
  
- Exploration of the relationship between loan amounts and interest rates
  
- Identification of patterns in loan approval and rejection rates across different customer segments
